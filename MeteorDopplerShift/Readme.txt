Python Script <MDopplerShift>

Requirements:
Python 3.4 or higher must be installed on your computer. It is not tested whether
<MDopplerShift> also runs under a former version of python 3.4. At least the following
modules are required:
- matplotlib
- tkinter
- math

It is recommended to install a complete python-package. <MDopplerShift> was developped 
with WinPython (http://winpython.sourceforge.net/) and used the 32bit version
3.4.4.6Qt5 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.4/3.4.4.6/).


How to install:
Copy <MDopplerShift_v32.py> to any folder if the path to python.exe is known
to your OS. Otherwise copy it into the folder that contains python.exe.

How to start:
Try one of the following methods:
-  If your python-package is fully registered to your OS double click
   <MDopplerShift_v32.py> otherwise right click and select python.exe as program
   for opening .py-files.
-  Open IDLE(X) from the Windows start menue (or double click IDLE(X).exe in the
   python folder). In IDLE(X) open <MDopplerShift_v32.py> and run it by pressing <F5>.
-  Under Windows open the Windows command line, change to the directory containing
   <MDopplerShift_v32.py> and enter the following command: python MDopplerShift_v32.py
